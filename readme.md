## What I'm Looking For

### The Work

I want to work at a company that's doing something exciting. Something that I can talk about with my friends and family with passion and enthusiasm. When asked, "How was work today?", I want to be able to say, "Oh, man! The flux capacitor was running hot, but I refactored the coupling and managed to squeeze out another jiggawatt!"

### The People

I like to think of myself as an easy-going, friendly and respectful person and I prefer to spend my time around people who think similarly of themselves. When you work with people that are cool and level-headed, the debate about tabs vs. spaces (__2 spaces!__) isn't quite as significant and you're able to focus on getting work done.

### The Culture

I love to be a productive contributor to a common goal, at the end of the day, I do it all for my family. Finding a sustainable work/life balance is crucial. Of course there will be times when you have to answer the phone, but when those instances become the norm instead of the rare exception, it's time to re-evaluate and find a better balance.
