My Resume
=========
I was updating my resume and realized that I could both create a new resume AND give an example of some code at the same time!

Viewing It
----------
If you want to skip all the UI stuff, you can jump straight to https://raw.github.com/ben-bradley/resume/master/resumes/ben-bradley.js to see the good stuff.

But, if you want to see it in all it's CSS-ified beauty, you can by:
```
git clone https://github.com/ben-bradley/resume
cd resume
npm install express
node ./resume
```
