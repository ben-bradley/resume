## What I'm Looking For

### The Work

I love working on back-end systems. Building efficient and intuitive APIs is something that I thoroughly enjoy. Learning to understand the data models and how best to interact with them is like untying a knot and putting together a jigsaw puzzle at the same time.

### The People

I like to think of myself as an easy-going, friendly and respectful person and I prefer to spend my time around people who think similarly of themselves. When you work with people that are cool and level-headed, the debate about tabs vs. spaces (__2 spaces!__) isn't a distraction and you're able to focus on getting work done.

### The Culture

I love to build things, solve problems, and make stuff happen, but at the end of the day, I do it all for my family. Finding a sustainable work/life balance is crucial. Of course there will be times when you have to answer the phone outside of "normal hours", but when that becomes the standard instead of the exception, it's time to re-evaluate in order to find a better balance.
